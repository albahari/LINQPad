<Query Kind="Expression" />

/* LINQPad includes around a dozen built-in snippets.

Right-click a table or queryable object in Schema Explorer to see them.

You can also drag any object onto the code editor.

TIP: If you have a Developer/Premium license, you can create your own Visual Studio-style snippets,
which you activate by typing the shortcut into the editor and pressing TAB. To create a custom
snippet, right-click the editor and choose 'Create Code Snippet'.
