// LINQPad Expression

/* Referencing assemblies that you've built in Visual Studio is a great way to test and experiment with your code.
   
Remember that you can Dump your custom types and they'll fully expand.

LINQPad does not lock your assembly files, so you can rebuild them and they'll instantly update LINQPad's autocompletion service.

Should your assembly references other assemblies, LINQPad will automatically add the transitive references.
If a .deps.json file is present, LINQPad will automatically parse it and harvest its NuGet references.

You can also access the internal classes of your assemblies - see query://Accessing_internal_members_of_assemblies_(InternalsVisibleTo)
