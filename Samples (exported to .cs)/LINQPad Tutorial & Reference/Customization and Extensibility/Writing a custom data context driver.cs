// LINQPad Statements

/* With LINQPad's Data Context extensiblity model, you can add support for other databases and querying sources.

In other words, you can write a plug-in that displays your own 'Add Connection' dialog  and then shows custom
objects in the Schema Explorer.

This is covered in detail online: https://www.linqpad.net/Extensibility.aspx  */
