// LINQPad Expression

/* You can include LINQPad sample scripts in NuGet packages, and LINQPad will display 
them automatically in the Samples treeview when the package is downloaded. If you're
the author of a NuGet package, this is a great way to get users immediately productive.

What's more, if your NuGet package includes LINQPad samples, users won't need a paid edition
of LINQPad to download your package. NuGet packages that contain LINQPad samples can be 
searched and downloaded by users of the free edition.

To proceed, copy the desired scripts into a folder called linqpad-samples before packaging,
and add the linqpad-samples tag to your NuGet submission.
