/* To see a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, go to Help | Search Commands.

Here are the most important shortcuts for code scratchpad use:

F5              - Execute  (you can also press Alt+X under Windows, or Shift-Command-X under macOS)
Shift+F5        - Cancel

Ctrl+1...Ctrl+9 - sets the script language. This is much faster than using the dropdown!

Alt+1...Alt+3   - collapse/expand result expansion to 1,2 or 3 levels (Control-Command-n on macOS)

Ctrl+R          - Hide/Show results (Command-R on macOS)

F4              - Script properties

Ctrl+Shift+C    - Clone script (Shift-Command-C on macOS).
                  This is your non-destructive experimentation button!
                  (Although the samples are read-only, so you can never destroy them.)
				  If you highlight a selection, just the selection is copied.
				  You can also right-click a script from 'My Scripts' and choose 'Use as Template for new script'.

Ctrl+Tab        - (Option-Tab on macOS) - switches between scripts, just like Visual Studio.
                  (There's also Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown which ignores last use,
				   and Alt+W / Control-Command-W which displays open scripts alphabetically.)

Ctrl+,          - locate/open a script by name (same as Visual Studio)

Ctrl+Shift+E    - (Shift-Command-E on macOS) - toggles results auto "Scroll-to-end"


FOR PRO/PREMIUM EDITION USERS:

Ctrl+Space           - auto-complete                (same as Visual Studio)
Ctrl+Shift+Space     - parameter info               (same as Visual Studio)
Alt+Enter or Ctrl+.  - open smart tag               (same as Visual Studio)
F2                   - rename symbol                (same as Visual Studio)
