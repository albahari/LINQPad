Here are the most important shortcuts for code scratchpad use:

F5 or Alt+X     - Execute
Shift+F5        - Cancel

Ctrl+1...Ctrl+9 - sets the Query Language. This is much faster than using the dropdown!

Alt+1...Alt+3   - collapse/expand result expansion to 1,2 or 3 levels

Ctrl+R          - Hide/Show query results

F4              - Query properties

Ctrl+Shift+C    - Clone query. This is your non-destructive experimentation button!
                  (Although the samples are read-only, so you can never destroy them.)
				  If you highlight a selection, just the selection is copied.
				  You can also right-click a query from 'My Queries' and choose 'Use as Template for new query'.

Ctrl+Tab        - switches between queries, just like Visual Studio.
                  (There's also Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown which ignores last use,
				   and Alt+W which displays open queries alphabetically.)

Ctrl+,          - locate/open a query by name (same as Visual Studio)

Ctrl+Shift+E    - toggles results auto "Scroll-to-end"


FOR PRO/PREMIUM EDITION USERS:

Ctrl+Space           - auto-complete                (same as Visual Studio)
Ctrl+Shift+Space     - parameter info               (same as Visual Studio)
Alt+Enter or Ctrl+.  - open smart tag               (same as Visual Studio)
F2                   - rename symbol                (same as Visual Studio)

*F12 invokes ILSpy if the definition is not within the source code.
