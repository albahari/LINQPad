// LINQPad Expression

/*
	In the bottom left, you'll see the 'My Scripts' TreeView. This shows all the files in
	your scripts folder (default location is My Documents/LINQPad Scripts, or ~/LINQPad/Scripts on macOS).
	
	You can open files with a single click. With a right-click, you can:
		- rename or delete
		- use a script as a template for creating another
		- locate the file in Windows Explorer.

	TIP: Click the 'Set Folder' hyperlink to change your scripts folder location.
	     Setting it to a OneDrive/DropBox folder will keep your scripts automatically synched.
