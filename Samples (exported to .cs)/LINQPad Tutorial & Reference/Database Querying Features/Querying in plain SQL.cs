// LINQPad Expression

/* By setting the language to SQL (Ctrl+7) you can execute plain SQL against a database.

This works whether you're querying SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, MySQL or SQLite.

When you set the query language to SQL, the Schema Explorer TreeView automatically updates to give 
you a SQL-centric (rather than LINQ-centric) view of the database.

TIP: You can make SQL the default language in Edit | Preferences | Query.
TIP: LINQPad supports the 'GO' keyword for issuing queries in separate batches.
