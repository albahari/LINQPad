// LINQPad Expression

/* Here are some tips, if you choose "Default (LINQ-to-SQL)":

 -	If the clipboard is populated with a connection string, LINQPad will parse the connection
	string and pre-fill the dialog for you.
	
 -	Tick 'Display columns in alphabetical order' if the columns in your database are not nicely ordered.
 	They'll then be much easier to find.
	
 -	LINQPad automatically pluralizes property names, unless you untick the 'Pluralize' checkbox.
 
 -	Passwords are encrypted with Windows DPAPI prior to storage. This means that if you send a script to
 	someone else, they won't see the connection password. If you want to override this and store the
	password in plain text, click 'Advanced' and in the additional connection string parameters box, put:
		password=<password>
		
 -	If you tick the "Contains production data" checkbox, you'll see a bright orange stripe in the editor 
 	whenever you use that connection, to you remind you.
	
 -	If you have a developer/premium edition, you can query multiple SQL databases at once. This is explained here:
