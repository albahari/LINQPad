// However, you can:
//  - see up to 25 million rows
//  - click headers to sort data (and type into the columns for incremental search)
//  - re-order columns by dragging
//  - freeze columns (right-click)
//  - make a rectangular selection and export to CSV/HTML/Excel
//
// Also, if you have a developer/premium license, you can edit output from LINQ-to-SQL and EF Core queries
// and save changes back to the database.
