// LINQPad Statements

/* You can enable compiler optimizations (equivalent to "release mode" in Visual Studio) with the toggle
   button on the bottom-right of the status bar. 
   
   With optimizations enabled, compute-intensive code runs faster, live execution tracking and debugging
   is disabled. Error reporting also becomes less accurate.
   
   This is a global setting. You can override it on a per-script basis by putting the following code at
   the start of your script:
   
   #LINQPad optimize+    // force optimizations on for this script
   #LINQPad optimize-    // force optimizations off for this script
