// LINQPad Statements

/* Sometimes your script will reference libraries that require application config files.
In .NET Core, these are implemented as .json files such as appsettings.json which are
copied into the application base directory (output folder in Visual Studio).

To make this work in LINQPad, just press F4 and add a reference to the .json configuration file.
It will then get copied to the application base directory.
